The two strikes were initiated by different groups of prisoners as the prisoner population had changed, and had differing goals. This case focuses more prominently on the first strike.

2. Immunity from punishment for all men who had led and participated in the strike.

“(1) All decisions, plans, and programs affecting the lives of black students, must be made in consultation with the Black Student Union.  This demand reflects our feeling that whites for too long have controlled the lives of non-whites.  We reject this control, instead we will define what our best interests are, and act accordingly.

(2) The Black Student Union should be given the financial resources and aids necessary to recruit and tutor non-white students.  Specifically, the Black Student Union wants to recruit: 300 Afro-American, 200 American Indians, and 100 Mexican students in September. 

(3) We demand that a Black Studies Planning Committee be set up under the direction and control of the Black Student Union.  The function of this Committee would be to develop a Black Studies Curriculum that objectively studies the culture and life-style of non-white Americans.

4) We want to work closely with the administration and faculty to recruit black teachers and administrators.  One positive effect from recruiting black teachers and administrators is that we will have role models to imitate, and learn from.

(5) We want black representatives on the music faculty.  Specifically, we would like to see Joe Brazil and Byron Polk hired.  The black man has made significant contributions to music (i.e. jazz and spirituals), yet there are not black teachers on the music faculty.”

Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, James Otis, Thomas Paine and other radicals who used pamphlets and meetings to stir up opposition to the British. Henry and Paine were also leaders in their legislatures (Virginia and Massachusetts respectively)
The American independence movement is notable for the fact that no king or dictator ever ran it or resulted from it. Very successful institution building and strong ideological adherence to the idea that no one should be a king ensured this.","Partners are hard to ascertain in this case because the taxes touched nearly every part of American colonial society. While some groups, such as New England merchants, participated initially due to frustration over the Stamp Act, they soon became a leading part of the movement, as evidenced by their involvement in the boycotts against other acts and participation of many Bostonians in the Boston Tea Party.","The colonists excelled at convincing undecided individuals to join their side. For example, merchants in the UK protested the Stamp Act to members of Parliament after the American boycott of British imports squeezed their business. Some members of Parliament believed that forcing the colonies to remain with Great Britain against their will would only drive the colonies to the side of Britain’s enemy, the French. Similarly, some French people helped the colonists either out of idealism or in hopes of eroding British power.","For lawyers and merchants, the Stamp Act was incredibly expensive because it required they pay a tax for every court document or documentation of an import agreement. Many legislatures, which were largely filled with the upper class due to voting restrictions, passed resolutions condemning the various acts and many joined in resistance groups.","The British Empire, its colonial agents, appointed governors of the colonies, Parliament",Repeals of several acts of Parliament following colonists’ opposition and campaigns,"Also very limited, because most colonists still saw the British as fellow countrymen and were aware that violence would alienate their supporters in Parliament and in the colonies and the UK.","Limited (to the credit of the British), but every act of repressive violence enormously benefited the colonists. The most famous incident of repressive violence was the Boston Massacre, during which 5 protestors died after British soldiers fired on a large group of colonists that had been taunting the British and throwing snowballs at them.

"California inmates hunger strike for humane conditions of confinement, 2011","""5 Core Demands:

1. Eliminate group punishments.  Instead, practice individual accountability. When an individual prisoner breaks a rule, the prison often punishes a whole group of prisoners of the same race.  This policy has been applied to keep prisoners in the SHU indefinitely and to make conditions increasingly harsh.  

  2. Abolish the debriefing policy and modify active/inactive gang status criteria. Prisoners are accused of being active or inactive participants of prison gangs using false or highly dubious evidence, and are then sent to longterm isolation (SHU). They can escape these tortuous conditions only if they 'debrief,' that is, provide information on gang activity. Debriefing produces false information (wrongly landing other prisoners in SHU, in an endless cycle) and can endanger the lives of debriefing prisoners and their families.  

3. Comply with the recommendations of the US Commission on Safety and Abuse in Prisons (2006) regarding an end to longterm solitary confinement.  This bipartisan commission specifically recommended to 'make segregation a last resort' and 'end conditions of isolation.'  Yet as of May 18, 2011, California kept 3,259 prisoners in SHUs and hundreds more in Administrative Segregation waiting for a SHU cell to open up.  Some prisoners have been kept in isolation for more than thirty years.  

  4. Provide adequate and nutritious food.  Prisoners report unsanitary conditions and small quantities of food that do not conform to prison regulations.  There is no accountability or independent quality control of meals.  

5. Expand and provide constructive programs and privileges for indefinite SHU inmates.  The hunger strikers are pressing for opportunities 'to engage in self-help treatment, education, religious and other productive activities...'  Currently these opportunities are routinely denied, even if the prisoners want to pay for correspondence courses themselves.  Examples of privileges the prisoners want are: one phone call per week, and permission to have sweatsuits and watch caps. (Often warm clothing is denied, though the cells and exercise cage can be bitterly cold.)  All of the privileges mentioned in the demands are already allowed at other SuperMax prisons (in the federal prison system and other states).""",,"1 July, 2011 to October, 2011",['United States'],California,Pelican Bay Prison,,"['001.
